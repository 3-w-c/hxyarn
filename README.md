# hxyarn

A Haxe port of [Yarn Spinner](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner)

This is currently a work in progress and not many features are implemented at this point.

Only supports .json yarn files.

## TODO

- Shortcut option support
- Formatted lines
- More Tests
- Stop using regex for language parsing ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
- Probably a lot more but I haven't actually started using this in a project
